# Adding Images to MySphere Website

## Founder Photos

You need to add the founder photos to make them appear on the About Us page:

1. **Naman's Photo**: 
   - Save the first image (Naman at ancient ruins) as `images/naman.jpg`
   - Replace the existing placeholder file

2. **Aarushi's Photo**: 
   - Save the second image (Aarushi outdoors) as `images/aarushi.jpg` 
   - Replace the existing placeholder file

## App Screenshots

You need to add the three app screenshots to showcase the MySphere app features:

1. **Accessibility Features Screen**: 
   - Save the first app screenshot (settings/preferences screen) as `images/app-screen-1.png`

2. **AI Assistant Sonia Screen**: 
   - Save the middle app screenshot (Sonia introduction screen) as `images/app-screen-2.png`

3. **Companion Matching Screen**: 
   - Save the third app screenshot (companion profiles/matching screen) as `images/app-screen-3.png`

## How to Add Images

### Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)
1. Open the `images/` folder in Finder
2. Drag each image file from your photos to the folder
3. Rename them exactly as specified above
4. Refresh your browser to see the changes

### Method 2: Save from Browser/Photos
1. Right-click on each image and "Save As..."
2. Navigate to the `images/` folder in your MySphere website directory
3. Save with the exact filenames listed above

## Image Requirements

- **Founder photos**: Should be square or portrait format, at least 400x400px
- **App screenshots**: Should maintain their original phone screen aspect ratio
- **File types**: `.jpg` for photos, `.png` for screenshots
- **File names**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Verification

After adding all images:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Check that founder photos appear on the About Us page
3. Check that app screenshots appear in the "Experience MySphere" section
4. If images don't appear, check that filenames match exactly

The website will automatically switch from placeholder graphics to your real images once they're properly named and placed in the `images/` folder.
